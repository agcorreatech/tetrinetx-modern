TetriNET X Modern - New GNU Tetrinet Server

This project is an update of the classic tetrinetx - GNU TetriNET Server -
to be supported by new linux distributions and C compiler versions.

This project started with the tetrinetx version 1.13.16 without qirc,
because the objective is to advance with the tetrinet server implementetion,
without interest in IRC Server or spectator features.

View the CHANGELOG file to follow what was done.

This code was built using Ubuntu and it was developed using Visual Studio
Code running in Windows 10, integrated with WSL (Windows Subsystem for
Linux) to compile and run the code in the native environment.
