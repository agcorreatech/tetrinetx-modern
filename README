TetriNET X Modern - New GNU Tetrinet Server

This project is an update of the classic tetrinetx - GNU TetriNET Server -
to be supported by new linux distributions and C compiler versions.

This project started with the tetrinetx version 1.13.16 without qirc,
because the objective is to advance with the tetrinet server implementetion,
without interest in IRC Server or spectator features.

View the CHANGELOG file to follow what was done.

This code was built using Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS and it was developed
using Visual Studio Code running in Windows 10, integrated with
WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to compile and run the code
in the native environment.

I appreciate your suggestions... send me an email.

This job is in progress and it is beign done by
Alexandro CorrÃªa <alex.linux@gmail.com> from Brazil.
