Wishlist, wants and Suggestions
-------------------------------

Overview
--------
Everything in here are the suggestions that people have made, some of them
being mine, that might be possible to be added to the Server side of
TetriNET.
If you're feeling enterprising, you may want to try tackle the coding of one
of these yourself, and if you get it right, send it in, and I'll merge it
with the current distribution.

NOTE: Some of these suggestions are not practical, but I've included them
anyway ;). By not practical, there is not too much of a need for some, or
some are simply impossible without modifying the client.


The List
--------

 * Add command /ban, /unban for op to ban IP's from the server.
	Note, I've hesitated on this since we may not want the op
	to have _that_ much power.

 * Give back time delays on Pings   (iAM - 17/9/98)

 * Have timeouts (crazor - 17/9/98)
	Timeout on events like field updates etc to detect lagged out
	people who hold a socket open.

 * Have a server side chat interface (crazor - 17/9/98)
	Allow someone on the server to be able to interact.

 * Allow the "op" to set a limit to the maximum players (crazor - 17/9/98)
	If you only want a 4 player game etc.. Also be able to give this
	info to grav (IE: 2/4 players current on)

 * Allow much more info to be sent to grav (crazor - 17/9/98)
	The settings of the game etc... Is it classic or not...

 * Plain Text Winlist file (jawfx@hotmail.com 21/9/98)
	Excellent idea. This allows a person to write the winlist to
	their local webpage. Because my server stores the top 100 players
	this can show ALL top 100 players :). What format should the
	file be written? How much info would a person want? (IE: Last
	date team/player played... average score... level reached...)

 * Allow OP to change player parameters (fade 23/9/98)

 * Implement a few "SERVER" commands  (Bundaberg 6/10/98)
	Add a few SERVER commands to the protocol, and build perhaps a
	windows client that allows the game configuration to be changed AND
	for the server to be able to moderate the server.

 * Extend /msg to allow 123 to message players 1 2 and 3 etc (iAM 8/10/98)
	iAM's suggestion was to eliminate /msg, and just be able to have
	123 as the beginning of a sentance to deliminate a private message.
	Upon thinking about this though, so many people say things like
	"123 v 456", which would mean it would be interpreted as a
	private message to players 1 2 and 3, and they'd get "v 456" ;)
	It would be nice to get rid of /msg, especially in game messages...

 * Extend "playerquery"        (NuKMan 9/10/98)
        Either extend "playerquery" or have a new init command which
        can provide the following information to the listbot:
                - Maximum number of players
                - Number of logged in players
                - Winlist

 * Add /whosi		(dds 11/10/98)
 * Have a secureop game options (dds 11/10/98)
	If this is set, then a person MUST use /op command and have a valid
	password to be able to use the /kick, /clear commands...
