Release 01 - 18/Jan/2020

- Finished the review of the code and replaced the old library varargs.h
by stdarg.h. The functions lvprintf(), tprintf() and lprintf() was rewritten.
No more errors, now the code can be compilled with modern GCC versions.

- All returns of the functions fscanf() has been treated as it should be, and
there is no more warnings about it in the compilation.

- Fixed some bugs with variable formats and type conversions everywhere, that
was giving warnings in the compilation. Now it's compiling like a charm!

- The code is now full functional and can be used! It is the original version
of the tetrinetx, but working in 2020!
